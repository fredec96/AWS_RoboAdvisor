# AWS RoboAdvisor

This project leveraged Amazon Web Services to create a RoboAdvisor that would output ideal stock/bond splits for a user. Amaxon Lex was used for Natural Language Processing and an Amazon Lambda function was integrated to provide the necessary functionality. Below are two examples of the project's functionality, first of the Lex bot before Lambda integration, and second of the Lex bot with Lambda integration.
